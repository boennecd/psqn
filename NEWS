Changes in version 0.2.1
 * tests that compile files using Rcpp::sourceCpp() now do so in a temporary
   directory in tempdir(). It was done before in the package directory which
   violates CRAN policies.

Changes in version 0.2.0
 * added a generic method for partially separable functions.
 * made it possible to run a setup function prior to evaluating all the element
   functions. Thus, some computations may be done once if possible. See
   https://github.com/boennecd/psqn-va-ex for an example.
 * made it possible to change the unsigned integer type used in the package by
   defining the PSQN_SIZE_T macro prior to including the header files from the
   package.
 * added the incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioner from Eigen to the
   package. This requires that one defines the PSQN_USE_EIGEN macro prior to
   including the header files from the package.

Changes in version 0.1.0 to 0.1.4
 * first submission to CRAN.
 * bug fixes of bugs found on CRAN's checks.
 * minor improvements.
