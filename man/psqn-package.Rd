\title{psqn: Partially Separable Quasi-Newton}
\description{
The main methods in the psqn package are the \code{\link{psqn}} and
\code{\link{psqn_generic}} function.
Notice that it is also possible to use the package from C++. This may
yield a large reduction in the computation time. See the vignette for
details e.g. by calling \code{vignette("psqn", package = "psqn")}.
A brief introduction is provided in the "quick-intro" vignette
(see \code{vignette("quick-intro", package = "psqn")}).

This package is fairly new. Thus, results may change and
contributions and feedback is much appreciated.
